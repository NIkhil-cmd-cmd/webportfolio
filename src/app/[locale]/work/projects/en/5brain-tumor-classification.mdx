## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify brain tumors based on MRI scans. The goal is to assist medical professionals in diagnosing tumors more accurately and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered a comprehensive dataset of MRI scans for training the model.
- **Model Development**: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify tumor types.
- **Evaluation**: Conducted extensive testing to evaluate model accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and model development.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring the model's accuracy across different tumor types. This required careful tuning of hyperparameters and extensive validation.

## Outcome

The model achieved a s accuracy of over 90%, demonstrating its potential as a diagnostic tool in medical settings.
